- **Focus Quality Indicator** (top-right) - Focus confidence circle
- **Label Corner Overlays** - Rectangle detection with confidence percentages
- **Quality Hints** - Contextual tips when quality is poor
- **Capture Button Enhancement** - Quality ring with progressive colors

### **3. Enhanced User Experience** 
- **Smart Haptic Feedback** - Different vibration patterns based on quality
- **Mode-Aware Detection** - Label detection only active in label capture mode
- **Non-Intrusive Design** - Assists without blocking workflow
- **Smooth Animations** - Professional transitions and visual feedback

### **4. Performance Optimizations**

- **Intelligent Activation** - QA features start/stop with camera lifecycle  
- **Memory Efficient** - Proper cleanup and resource management
- **Battery Conscious** - Sensor throttling and smart sampling

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Instructions**

### **Quick Test Setup**
1. **Run the app** with `flutter run`
2. **Login** with test credentials:
   - **Profile A (Direct Labels)**: Email with "A", Password "A" (e.g., `a@a.com` / `a`)
   - **Profile B (Scene â†’ Labels)**: Email with "B", Password "B" (e.g., `b@b.com` / `b`)

### **QA Features Testing**

#### **1. Device Stabilization Test**
- **Open camera** (either profile)
- **Move device around** while watching **top-left indicator**
- **Expected**: Color changes from Green (stable) â†’ Orange (moving) â†’ Red (shaky)
- **Feel**: Gentle vibration when device becomes stable

#### **2. Focus Quality Test**  
- **Tap to focus** on different objects
- **Watch top-right circle** change colors
- **Expected**: Green (sharp) â†’ Orange (soft) â†’ Red (blurred) â†’ Grey (focusing)

#### **3. Label Detection Test** (Profile B Only)
- **Complete scene capture** first (Profile B workflow)
- **Switch to Labels mode** 
- **Point at rectangular objects** (books, labels, boxes)
- **Expected**: Green rectangle overlays with confidence percentages

#### **4. Quality Ring Test**
- **Watch capture button** for colored ring around edge
- **Move device** to change stability
- **Expected**: Ring color matches overall quality (Green â†’ Orange â†’ Red)

#### **5. Haptic Feedback Test**
- **Capture photos** with different quality levels
- **Expected Vibrations**:
  - Excellent Quality â†’ Medium impact
  - Good Quality â†’ Light impact  
  - Poor Quality â†’ Selection click

### **6. Mode Switching Test** (Profile B)
- **Scene Mode**: Only stability + focus indicators
- **Labels Mode**: All QA features including label detection
- **Verify**: QA system properly reconfigures when switching modes

## ðŸ“± **What Operators Will Experience**

### **Visual Feedback**
- **Discrete indicators** that don't obstruct camera view
- **Helpful hints** only when quality could be improved
- **Professional animations** that enhance rather than distract
- **Color-coded feedback** that's easy to understand at a glance

### **Tactile Feedback**  
- **Quality-based vibrations** that confirm capture quality
- **Non-disruptive** - gentle feedback that doesn't startle
- **Contextual** - different patterns for different situations

### **Workflow Integration**
- **Zero learning curve** - works alongside existing interface
- **No blocking** - can always capture regardless of QA status
- **Mode-aware** - adapts behavior based on workflow context
- **Battery friendly** - intelligent power management

## ðŸ”§ **Key Implementation Notes**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Modular design** - Easy to extend and modify individual components
- **Stream-based communication** - Reactive updates between components
- **Platform integration** - Uses Flutter's sensor and camera APIs effectively
- **Memory management** - Proper disposal and cleanup patterns

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Sensor throttling** - Prevents battery drain from excessive polling
- **Efficient animations** - GPU-accelerated transforms and opacity changes  
- **Smart activation** - QA system only runs when camera is active
- **Background processing** - Minimal impact on UI thread

### **Future Enhancement Ready**
- **ML Model Integration** - Label detector prepared for real computer vision
- **Adaptive Thresholds** - Quality thresholds can be tuned per store/user
- **Analytics Integration** - QA metrics logged for analysis
- **Custom Profiles** - Store-specific QA configurations
