## ✅ ALL COMPILATION ISSUES FIXED!

**Problems Resolved:**
1. ❌ Duration constructor with computed values → ✅ Pre-computed variables
2. ❌ DateFormat null check operators → ✅ Custom time formatting functions
3. ❌ Intl dependency issues → ✅ Removed unnecessary imports

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `DateFormat('HH:mm').format()` with custom `_formatTime()` function
- Fixed Duration constructor in camera screen
- Removed intl dependency from problematic files
- Added proper null safety handling

**Ready to Launch:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

🚀 **All 8 screens should now work perfectly!**
