## âœ… **FIXED REMAINING CONTROLLER REFERENCES**

**Problem:** There were still some references to the commented-out `controller` variable.

**Solution:** Replaced the controller check with `if (false)` to ensure it always goes to mock mode.

**Ready to Test:**
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Expected Result:**
- Chrome opens with the app
- Login screen appears
- Full navigation flow works
- Camera screen shows "MOCK CAMERA PREVIEW"
- All features work in simulation mode

ðŸš€ **This should now compile and run successfully!**

**What You'll Be Able to Test:**
1. Login â†’ Home screen
2. Start New Session â†’ Store selection
3. Location selection (Area â†’ Aisle â†’ Segment)
4. Camera screen with ML simulation
5. Session summary with statistics
6. Upload queue with progress tracking
7. Settings screen with all options

The foundation is complete and ready for real camera integration!
