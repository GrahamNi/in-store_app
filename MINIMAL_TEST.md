## ðŸ”§ **TESTING WITH MINIMAL DEPENDENCIES**

**Strategy:** 
- Commented out camera dependencies temporarily
- Using mock camera preview with all UI features
- Testing core navigation and state management
- Will add real camera back once basic compilation works

**Current Status:**
- All screens built and connected
- Camera screen shows "MOCK CAMERA PREVIEW" 
- All navigation flows work
- ML simulation still functional

**Test Command:**
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Next Steps:**
1. âœ… Get basic app compiling and running
2. Add camera dependency back gradually
3. Test on Android device with real camera
4. Polish and refine

This approach ensures we can test the full user flow while isolating camera-specific issues.
